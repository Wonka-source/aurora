## Planning
In the GitHub repository Issues were used as an Agile tool for the project. User stories were defined using Github issues. Development of each of the user stories were managed using a Kanban board.

## Theme, Epic and User stories

### Theme
To sell high end luxery watches online, and provide watch servicing and repairs.


### Epic

### User stories

## Design and UX

The main color scheme comprises green, off-white, and grey shades, the logo features complementary green and grey colors. Across some of the site's pages, there is an image of a green grid mat with watch parts and tools, matching well with the logo and the theme. The site's navbar features Font Awesome icons for each navigation link, visually representing each section of the site.



The colors implemented across the site are:

Green: #008000

Grey: #888282

White: #ffffff

Off-White: #f8f9fa

-   Then push your code to update the app.

### Update Heroku in the terminal:
-  Navigate to  [https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/applications](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account/applications)

-  In Authorizations click on create authorization button
-  Add description in pop up eg.heroku cli and leave expire after blank if you don't want it to expire
-  You will get authorization token
